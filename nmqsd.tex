\section{The Microscopical Model}
\label{sec:nmqsd.model}
% * standard model (why oscillators, why linear coupling?)
% * relative states, good choice:
% * Bargman States, hilbert space valued functions
% * reduced density operator
% * zero temperature, importance for calculations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As mentioned above, the main objective of this work is the description of a system under the influence of an environment.
