\subsection{The Aggregat Hamiltonian}
\label{sub:app.model.hamiltonian}

% GENERAL MOLECULE
% ---------------
% * molecular Hamiltonian, Born Oppenheimer approx (large difference in mass)
%     => seperation of time scales,
% * split into electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom
% * in aggregat further vibrational degrees of freedom: inter- and intramolecular as well as solvent
%
% FIXME Rename V_mn since we use it below for matrix elements

In the follwing chapter we treat molecular aggregats with a size in the order of magnitude from a few up to a hundred molecules.
Let us consider the latter composed of electrons and point-like nuclei quantum mechanically described by canonical-conjugated pairs of operators $(p_j, q_j)$ and $(P_j, Q_j)$ respectively.
The corresponding Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{equation}
  \opH{mol} = \opT{el} + \opT{nuc} + \opV{el-el} + \opV{nuc-nuc} + \opV{el-nuc}
  \label{eq:app.mol_hamil}
\end{equation}
% TODO More?
with the kinetic energies $T$ and appropriate Coulomb interactions $V$.
% TODO Really?
We drop possible contributions from internal spin degrees of freedom since they induce only negligible corrections for the systems under consideration.

The vast difference in masses of electrons and nuclei allows us to separate the dynamics of both into two individual parts using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation:
As electrons move on a much faster time scale they can respond to any changes in the nuclear arrangement almost instantaneously.
This amounts to including the motion of nuclei mediated by the Coulomb potential $\opV{el-nuc}$ only adiabatically when calculating the electron dynamics from \autoref{eq:app.mol_hamil}.
% TODO Is this clear and to the point?
Therefor we can reorganize the summands in \autoref{eq:app.mol_hamil} more appropriately to
\begin{equation}
  \opH{mol} = \opH{el}(\QQ) + \opT{nuc} + \opV{nuc-nuc},
  \label{eq:app.mol_hamil_bo}
\end{equation}
where the notation $\opH{el} = \opT{el} + \opV{el-el} + \opV{el-nuc}(\QQ)$ indicates that we regard the electronic Hamiltonian to depend only parametrically on the nuclear coordinates $\QQ$.
% FIXME Notice??
For the processes under consideration only the valence electrons need to be taken into account explicitly; others are included to the nucleon-part without further notice.


% FIXME In all possible combinations?
The same reasoning applies to the complete Hamiltonian of the aggregat, which besides contributions of the form~\ref{eq:app.mol_hamil} for each individual molecule contains intermolecular interactions between electrons and nuclei in all possible combinations.
Therefore it can rephrased similarly to \autoref{eq:app.mol_hamil_bo}
\begin{equation}
  \opH{agg} = \opH{el}(\QQ) + \opT{vib} + \opV{vib-vib},
  \label{eq:app.agg_hamil}
\end{equation}
Here we use the more general notion of vibrational degrees of freedom, which not only comprises the intra- and intermolecular nuclear coordinates, but also possible environmental degrees of freedom not belonging to the aggregat.
These appear for example when studying molecular compounds immersed in a liquid solvent.

% ELECTRONIC PART
% ---------------
% * Holstein model
% * no exchange interaction due to seperation of molecules, no overlap (tight binding)
%     => anti-symmetrization in Hartree anatz non necessary; product basis
%        =>   H_el = Σ_ma ε_ma |φ_ma><φ_ma|  +  ½ Σ ...

The Born-Oppenheimer approximation allows us to analyse the electronic separately from the vibrational part of \autoref{eq:app.agg_hamil} for a fixed coordinate vector $\QQ$.
We split up the former into contributions for each individual electron
\begin{equation*}
  \opH{el} = \sum_m H_m^\mathrm{(el)} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{m,n} U_{mn}^\mathrm{(el-el)},
\end{equation*}
where $H_m^\mathrm{(el)}$ contains the $m$\th electron's kinetic energy as well as its coupling to the vibrational degrees of freedom and $U_{mn}$ is simply the Coulomb interaction between the $m$\th and $n$\th electron.
The \quotes{free} Hamiltonians $H_m^\mathrm{(el)}$ define distinct electronic states by
\begin{equation*}
  H_m^\mathrm{(el)}(\QQ) \varphi_{ma} (q, \QQ) = \epsilon_{ma}(\QQ) \varphi_{ma} (q, \QQ)
\end{equation*}
for each given environmental configuration $\QQ$.
The index $m$ runs over all electrons under consideration and $a$ is used to label the individual states, which we assume to be ordered by the corresponding energies.
Similar to the Hartree-Fock method we build up an expansion basis for the total electronic state by a product ansatz
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{\vec a}(\qq, \QQ) = \prod_m \varphi_{m, a_m}(q_m, \QQ),
  \label{eq:app.product_states}
\end{equation}
which in general needs to be anti-symmetrized to fulfill the Pauli exclusion principle.

If there is at most one valence electron per molecule we need to take into consideration, which is furthermore tightly bound, then the situation simplifies dramatically:
In this case the spreading of the single-electron states $\ket{\varphi_{ma}} = \ket{m, a}$ is small compared to the distance between two molecules; we can neglect the overlap $\braket{m, a}{n, b}$ for different molecules $m \neq n$.
Consequently \autoref{app.product_states} yields a complete basis for the electronic degrees of freedom.
We also have the following representation for the Hamiltonian~\ref{eq:app.agg_hamil}% FIXME Formula!
\begin{equation}
  \opH{el} = \sum_{m, a} \epsilon_{m, a} \, \ket{m, a}\bra{m, a} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{m,n,a,b,a',b'} U_{mn}(aa', bb') \, \ket{m,a; n,b}\bra{m,a'; n,b'}
  \label{eq:app.agg_hamil_basis}
\end{equation}
with the matrix elements of the Coulomb interaction\footnote{%
  % TODO Mutual enough?
  This does not include the exchange interaction, since we assume a vanishing mutual overlap for the electrons.
}
\begin{equation*}
  U_{mn}(aa', bb') = \bra{m,a; n,b} U_{mn} \ket{m,a'; n,b'}.
\end{equation*}
% TODO Is this correct?
Note that all terms in \autoref{eq_app.agg_hamil_basis} still depend on vibrational coordinates.
For example the matrix elements $U_{mn}(aa'; bb')$ is influenced by the distance between the $m$\th and $n$\th molecule, while the electronic eigenenergies $\epsilon_{m, a}$ primarily depend on the positions of other electrons belonging to the same molecule.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The Exciton Model}
\label{sub:app.model.exciton}
% * beside electronic ground state only first excited singlet state φ_m^g, φ_m^e for each molecule
%     => effective 2 level system
%     * ok if only one S_1 state is initially excited and all first-level energies are same order of magnitude
% * different contributions to interaction term; Heitler-London approximation (p.370)
%     => Interaction term gives only "hopping" contributions (resonant excitation energy transfer)
%     => if we start with single excitation, we remain in the single-excitation Hilbert space
%     => basis vectors |π_n> = |φ_n^e> Π_i≠n |φ_i^g> => single exciton state
%     * need ground state |0> = Π_i |φ_i^g> as well due to dissipation
%     * multi-exciton states for nonlinear stuff
%     * interaction matrix elements can be calculated from center-of-mass coordinate of molecule and Coulomb interaction
%        => more details (dipole approximation, etc.) in spectrum-section
%
% TODO Dipol-Dipol interactoin approximation (p.372)

% TODO Good? Position of footnote?
% FIXME I am too long!!!
In order to describe the experimental setting described in the introduction we do not need to consider the complete electronic Hamiltonian~\ref{eq:app.agg_hamil_basis}:
if only a single valence electron is initially in the lowest excited state $S_1$ above its ground state $S_0$\footnote{%
  Note that $S_0$ describes the lowest energy state of the valence electron with all other electrons of the molecule fixed, not to be confused with the atomic ground states.
}
and if the various transition energies are in the same order of magnitude, then it is sufficient to take only the $S_0$ state $\ket{m, 0}$ as well as the first excited stated $\ket{m, 1}$ for each molecule into account.
% FIXME Is charged induced transition a word?
Under these circumstances the matrix elements $U_{mn}(aa', bb')$ can be classified with respect to a few physical processes such as electrostatic interactions or charge-induced transitions.
But most important is the resonant contribution $U_{mn}(01; 10)$ (and its inversion $U_{mn}(10; 01)$) describing a $S_0 \to S_1$ excitation for the $m$\th electron induced by a  $S_0 \to S_1$ transition at the $n$\th molecule.
In the following we neglect all but the last class of processes, which is frequently called Heitler-London approximation.

Restricting the allowed electronic states to the two lowest energy levels has a remarkable interpretation in terms of quasi-particles:
The product
\begin{equation}
  \ket{m} = \ket{m, 1} \prod_{n \neq m} \ket{n, 0}
  \label{eq:app.exciton_state}
\end{equation}
% TODO What about gorund state?
% FIXME Too much due to, therefore,...
describes an excited electron localized in the vicinity of the $m$\th molecule, which we refer to as an exciton of the electronic system.
Due to the Heitler-London approximation our adiabatic Hamiltonian~\ref{eq:app.agg_hamil_basis} conserves the number of excitons.
Therefore an initial state $\ket{m}$ (or linear combinations thereof) always remains in the one-exciton Hilbert space $\HH^{(1)}$.
% TODO WHY???
The interaction matrix elements
\begin{equation*}
  V_{mn} = V_{nm} = \bra{m, 0; n, 1} U_{mn} \ket{m, 1; n, 0}
\end{equation*}
allow us to express the restriction of $\opH{el}$ to $\HH^{(1)}$ as
\begin{equation*}
  \opH{el}^{(1)}(\QQ) = \sum_m \epsilon_m(\QQ) \ket{m}\bra{m} + \sum_{m,n} V_{mn}(\QQ) \ket{n}\bra{m}.
\end{equation*}
% FIXME Second sentence strange...
For the rest of this section we assume the $V_{mn}$ to be independent of vibrational degrees of freedom; a more general treatment poses no further difficulties.\\

% VIBRATIONAL PART
% ----------------
% * include dynamica

% FIXME Too much "degrees of freedom"
Up to this point we have neglected the dynamical evolution of the vibrational environment, which is essential in a complete description of a molecular aggregat.
% TODO REALLY? WHY?
In common settings for the physical systems under consideration a harmonic approximation is sufficient to obtain a realistic model.
There are two reasons for this:
First of all most proteins disintegrate at temperatures much higher than room temperature; therefore thermal excitation only leads to small energy gains for each vibrational degree of freedom.
The other mechanism for driving the environment is dissipation of the electronic system.
But the latter is small compared to the vast number of vibrational degrees of freedom and energy typically spreads evenly across the environment.
We can thusly assume that all $Q_\lambda$ experience only a small displacement from their equilibrium positions, which we set to $Q_\lambda = 0$.

% TODO More?
As a consequence both $\opV{vib-vib}(\QQ)$ and $\epsilon_m(\QQ)$ can be expanded in a Taylor series neglecting all but the first non-trivial term.
To alleviate notation we further assume that each vibrational degree of freedom only couples to one specific exciton.
This leads to exactly the original model we use to derive the NMSSE: a bath of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to the electronic system
\begin{align*}
  \opH{agg} =
  \sum_m \epsilon_m(0) \ket{m}\bra{m} + \sum_{m,n} V_{mn} \ket{m}\bra{n} + \sum_{m, \lambda} \omega_{m, \lambda} \adj{A}_{m, \lambda} A_{m, \lambda} \\
  + \sum_{m, \lambda} g_{m, \lambda} \ket{m}\bra{m} \otimes \left( \adj{A}_{m, \lambda} + A_{m, \lambda} \right),
\end{align*}
where $A_{m, \lambda}/\adj{A}_{m, \lambda}$ are ladder operators corresponding to the $\lambda$\th vibrational mode coupling to the $m$\th exciton.
