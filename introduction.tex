\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
% * Classical/Quantum closed time evolution
% * necessity for open systems

\section{Classical Open Systems}
\label{sec:into.open_classical}
% * possibly only true closed system: universe
% * classical open systems
% * Brownian motion
% * colission based models
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Open Quantum Systems}
\label{sec:intro.open_quantum}
% * Two approaches: embedding into larger/axiomatic, why we choose later
% * density operators/master equations, lindblad
% * feynman-vernon
% * projection operator
% * markovian stochastic schrödinger equations
% * markov vs nonmarkov
% * Measure of non-Markovianity
% * Why SSE? --> ρ always positive --> \cite{GaWi02_real_nmsse}
% * Linblad master equation --> unravelling --> connection to Feynman-Kac
% * quapi
% * Connection to linear response theory Weiss Ch. 6
