            decoherence of the two macroscopically distinct components of such
            a state is thermally enhanced, the rise of a classically interpretable
            signal indicating `life' or `death' is not. Suitable averages over
            the noises could be obtained from a well known master equation and
            demand interpretation in terms of ensembles, but results contingent
            on single realizations of the noises may be related to single runs
